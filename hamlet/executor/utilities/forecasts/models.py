user can also define own model-object (class) here. some basic rules:
1. The model object (class) must use the @forecast_model decorator. The c.TC_NAME argument should be the same string as 
defined in config file to identify models.
2. The model object (class) must inherits from class ModelBase, which contains the train data to be forecasted as 
attribute. The train data is a dictionary consists of two keys: c.K_TARGET and c.K_FEATURES. The values are both polars
Dataframes.
3. The predict() method of the object must be implemented, fit() is optional. Two args will be passed to both methods 
for all models:
    Args:
        current_ts: Current timestep when making the fitting / prediction.
        length_to_predict: How long in the future should be covered in the resulting forecast of this model. Unit:
        seconds.
4. If extra args needed, define in config file with exact same names. 
5. All functions need to contain **kwargs to make overall structure working.
6. The predict() method needs to return a polars Dataframe with the forecasting result in the same column name as the
target column name.
