        Apply control via EMS to the given bus under the given transformer power and combined loading.

        First check the transformer power and the bus power. Only apply control via EMS if the transformer is importing
        power (i.e. the overload is due to the over-consumption) and the bus is consuming power, or if the transformer
        is exporting power (i.e. the overload is due to the over-generation) and the bus is generating power. Otherwise,
        the control via EMS is not necessary since the bus is not really contributing to the overload, and this function
        directly returns the same results as stored previously in grid database.

        During control via EMS, the total power reduction command among all devices will be sent to the EMS by taking
        the smaller value between the power to be reduced to bring the combined loading < 100% and the maximal reducible
        power according to ยง14a. The EMS can freely distribute the power reduction among all devices. For
        over-consumption, batteries with a power consumption (charging) > threshold, EVs with a power consumption
        (charging) > threshold, and heat pumps with a power consumption > threshold are considered for calculating the
        maximal reducible power according to ยง14a. For over-generation, batteries with a power generation (discharging)
