HAMLET

**H**ierarchical **A**gent-based **M**arkets for **L**ocal **E**nergy **T**rading

An open-source tool for the agent-based development and testing of energy market applications (at a local level).

## Description

Due to the increasing complexity of energy systems, the need for more detailed and realistic models has arisen. 
Agent-based models are a promising approach to model the behavior of individual actors in energy systems. For this 
purpose, we developed HAMLET, a modular and extendable open-source toolbox for the development and testing of market 
designs with a focus on local interactions at the distribution level. HAMLET is designed to be used by researchers 
to investigate the interactions between market participants and the impact of different market designs on the technical 
and economic performance of energy systems.

HAMLET was developed with extendability and modularity in mind. Therefore, each functionality can be easily swapped for 
another to test, for example, other market clearing algorithms, trading strategies, or control strategies. The aim of 
the tool is to provide a common platform for researchers to develop and test their own market designs and to compare 
their results with other market designs.

A documentation is currently being developed and will be available soon.

HAMLET was developed and is maintained by the 
[Chair of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Systems](https://www.epe.ed.tum.de/en/ens/homepage/) of the [Technical
University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). Version 0.1 (February 2024) was developed as part of the research project 
[STROM](https://www.epe.ed.tum.de/en/ens/research/projects/current-projects/strom-sp-3/), funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, 
Regional Development and Energy.

## Features
HAMLET offers...
* a fully open-source, agent-based energy market modelling toolbox
* a modular and extendable design for easy adaptation to your own research questions
* integrated time-series data for several plant types (household loads, pv, wind, heat pumps, electric vehicles etc...)
* template functionality for load and generation forecasting, trading strategies, market clearing
  algorithms and control strategies and much more...

so you only need to adapt the components you want to investigate and/or improve on

## Installation
HAMLET is completely based on Python to keep the installation process simple. This installation guide will
explain how to get HAMLET to run using PyCharm, Gurobi and Anaconda as example. However, other IDEs and package managers
are perfectly suitable as well.

#### Install the following software:
	- IDE: e.g. PyCharm
	- Package Manager: e.g. Anaconda
	- Solver: e.g. Gurobi* or CPLEX. GLPK can be used although this is non-ideal.

    *Installation explained later in this README

#### Clone repository
You can download or clone the repository to a local directory of your choice. You can use version control tools such as 
GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree, GitKraken or pure Git. The link for pure Git is: 

`git clone https://github.com/tum-ewk/hamlet.git`

If using PyCharm, clone the repository, for example, to `./PyCharmProjects/hamlet/`
###
#### Create a virtual python environment
	- Open the AnacondaPrompt.
	- Type `conda env create -f ./PycharmProjects/hamlet/env.yml`
	- Take care to set the correct (absolute) path to your cloned repository.

#### Activate the environment
	- Open PyCharm
	- Go to 'File->Open'
	- Navigate to PyCharmProjects and open hamlet
	- When the project has opened, go to 
         `File->Settings->Project->Python Interpreter->Show all->Add->Conda Environment
          ->Existing environment->Select folder->OK`

#### Install a solver (we recommend Gurobi)
	- Go to gurobi.com
	- Create an account with your university email 
	- When the account has been activated, log in and download the newest Gurobi solver.
	- Go to Academia->Academic Program and Licenses
	- Follow the installation instructions under "Individual Academic Licenses" to activate your copy of Gurobi

### Test your installation
    - Navigate to ./PycharmProjects/hamlet/01 - examples
	- Execute 01_create_scenario.py, followed by 02_execute_scenario.py
    - When the simulation has completed (this may take some time, depending on your system), 
      analyze the results by executing 03_analyze_scenario.py (no analysis available yet)
	- Look at the output plots under hamlet/05_results/example_singlemarket/analysis/ (once implemented)
