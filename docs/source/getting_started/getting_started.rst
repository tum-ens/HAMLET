Getting Started with HAMLET
===========================

Welcome to HAMLET (Hierarchical Agent-based Markets for Local Energy Trading), an agent-based energy system simulation tool! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

What is HAMLET?
---------------
HAMLET is designed to support energy experts in researching various aspects of the energy system. The tool is split into three components that are crucial for energy system simulations:

1. **Creator**: Facilitates the creation of agents, markets, and grids for the scenarios.
2. **Executor**: Runs the scenarios and simulations.
3. **Analyzer**: Analyzes and visualizes the simulation results.

Who Should Use HAMLET?
----------------------
HAMLET is ideal for:

- **Researchers**: Conduct energy system experiments that rely on agent-based modeling without having to code from scratch.
- **Energy system engineers**: Plan and optimize energy grids by analyzing energy flows based on aspects such as individual agent behavior, market dynamics, and legislation.
- **Policy makers**: Evaluate the impact of policies on energy systems to find better solutions.
- **Grid operators**: Analyze the impact of different energy system designs on the grid and vice versa.
- **Educators**: Teach energy system concepts using an agent-based modeling approach.
- **Developers**: Extend the tool for custom workflows.

Who Should Not Use HAMLET?
--------------------------
HAMLET is not suitable for:

- **Non-technical users**: Requires basic programming knowledge for customization.
- **Users with limited time**: Requires a learning curve for customization as the users need to know the tool as well as the complexity of the energy system.
- **Large-scale simulations**: Depending on the methods applied and the hardware available, HAMLET might not be the best choice due to its computing intensive nature.

Key Features:
-------------
- Modular architecture: Extend the tool with custom components for all aspects of the agents, markets, and grids.
- Scalable simulations: Handle small to mid-scale scenarios (scale heavily dependent on hardware, duration, number of agents and methods).
- Customizable workflows: Define unique configurations for diverse needs.
