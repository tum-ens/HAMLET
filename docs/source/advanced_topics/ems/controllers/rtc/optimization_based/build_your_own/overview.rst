Building Your Own Optimization-Based Controller
===========================================

Introduction
-----------

This section provides guidance on how to create your own custom optimization-based controller in HAMLET. By extending the existing framework, you can implement specialized control strategies tailored to your specific energy system requirements.

Prerequisites
------------

Before building your own optimization-based controller, you should have:

- A good understanding of mathematical optimization concepts
- Familiarity with the HAMLET framework and its component models
- Knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of the specific requirements for your energy system

General Steps
------------

1. **Define Your Mathematical Formulation**
   
   - Identify the objective function(s) for your controller
   - Determine the necessary constraints
   - Select appropriate decision variables
   - Consider time coupling and horizon requirements

2. **Choose an Implementation Approach**
   
   - Linopy-based implementation
   - PyOptInterface-based implementation
   - Custom solver integration

3. **Implement the Controller**
   
   - Create a new controller class
   - Implement the required methods
   - Define the optimization problem
   - Connect to the HAMLET framework

4. **Test and Validate**
   
   - Verify mathematical correctness
   - Test with simple scenarios
   - Compare against existing controllers
   - Validate with realistic use cases

Implementation Examples
---------------------

This section will include code examples and templates for creating custom controllers.
