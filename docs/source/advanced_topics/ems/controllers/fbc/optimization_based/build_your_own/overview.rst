Building Your Own Optimization-Based Forecast-Based Controller
=======================================================

Introduction
-----------

This section provides guidance on how to create your own custom optimization-based forecast-based controller (FBC) in HAMLET. By extending the existing framework, you can implement specialized control strategies tailored to your specific energy system requirements, taking advantage of forecasts and multi-period optimization.

Prerequisites
------------

Before building your own optimization-based FBC, you should have:

- A good understanding of mathematical optimization concepts, particularly multi-period optimization
- Familiarity with the HAMLET framework and its component models
- Knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of forecast integration and receding horizon control
- Understanding of the specific requirements for your energy system

General Steps
------------

1. **Define Your Mathematical Formulation**
   
   - Identify the objective function(s) for your controller over the prediction horizon
   - Determine the necessary constraints, including temporal coupling constraints
   - Select appropriate decision variables for each timestep in the horizon
   - Define how forecasts will be integrated into the problem
   - Consider terminal constraints or costs for the end of the horizon

2. **Choose an Implementation Approach**
   
   - Linopy-based implementation (higher-level, more concise)
   - PyOptInterface-based implementation (lower-level, more control)
   - Custom solver integration

3. **Implement the Controller**
   
   - Create a new controller class
   - Implement the required methods for multi-period optimization
   - Define the optimization problem with time dimension
   - Implement the receding horizon approach
   - Connect to the HAMLET framework

4. **Test and Validate**
   
   - Verify mathematical correctness
   - Test with simple scenarios
   - Compare against existing controllers
   - Validate with realistic use cases
   - Test with different forecast qualities to assess robustness

Handling Forecasts
----------------

A key aspect of building an FBC is properly integrating forecasts:

1. **Forecast Sources**
   - Determine which forecasts your controller needs (weather, prices, loads, etc.)
   - Decide how to obtain these forecasts (from HAMLET's forecasting module or external sources)

2. **Forecast Uncertainty**
   - Consider how to handle forecast uncertainty (e.g., robust optimization, stochastic programming)
   - Implement fallback strategies for when forecasts are unavailable or unreliable

3. **Forecast Horizon**
   - Determine the appropriate forecast horizon for your application
   - Consider the trade-off between horizon length and computational complexity

Implementing Receding Horizon Control
----------------------------------

The receding horizon approach is central to FBCs:

1. **Optimization Horizon**
   - Define the length of the optimization horizon
   - Consider the trade-off between horizon length and computational complexity

2. **Control Execution**
   - Implement the logic to apply only the first timestep's decisions
   - Update the system state based on the applied decisions

3. **Re-optimization**
   - Implement the logic to shift the horizon forward and re-solve the problem
   - Update forecasts with the latest available information

Extension Points
--------------

The HAMLET framework provides several extension points for custom FBCs:

- Custom objective functions over the prediction horizon
- Component-specific constraints with temporal coupling
- Alternative solver configurations for large-scale problems

Best Practices
------------

- Start with a simplified version of your controller (shorter horizon, fewer components)
- Incrementally add complexity
- Document your mathematical formulation, especially temporal coupling constraints
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables across timesteps
- Include appropriate tests for different forecast scenarios
- Consider computational efficiency (problem size grows with horizon length)
- Implement warm-starting to speed up successive optimizations
