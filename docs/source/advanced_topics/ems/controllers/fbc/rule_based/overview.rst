Rule-based Methods for Forecast-Based Control
=====================================

Currently there are no rule-based methods implemented for forecast-based controllers. Feel free to expand the framework with your own rule-based forecast-based controllers!

Potential approaches for rule-based forecast-based controllers could include:

- Rule-based systems that consider forecasted values over a prediction horizon
- Fuzzy logic controllers that incorporate forecast uncertainty
- Decision trees that branch based on forecasted conditions

If you implement a rule-based forecast-based controller, consider contributing it back to the HAMLET project.
