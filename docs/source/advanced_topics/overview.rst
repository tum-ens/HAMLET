Overview
========

Introduction
------------

The Advanced Topics section provides in-depth information about HAMLET's more complex features and capabilities. This section is intended for users who are already familiar with the basic concepts and want to either dive even deeper into the ecosystem or adapt or expand either existing or new modules.

Key Advanced Topics
-------------------

The following advanced topics are covered in the documentation:

1. **Configuration Guide**: Comprehensive documentation on configuring all aspects of HAMLET simulations, including agents, markets, grids, and more.

2. **Energy Management System (EMS)**: Detailed information about the decision-making components within agents.

.. 3. **API Reference**: Technical documentation for developers who want to extend HAMLET or integrate it with other tools.

When to Use Advanced Features
-----------------------------

Consider exploring these advanced topics when:

- You need to model complex energy systems and understand the ins and outs of the tool
- You are developing extensions to HAMLET's core functionality
- Your research requires custom methods that expand the framework. These could be (among others):

    - Agents: Forecasting methods, control strategies or bidding strategies
    - Markets: Novel market mechanisms or market types
    - Grids: Integrate new physical constraints or new energy grids (e.g. heat)
